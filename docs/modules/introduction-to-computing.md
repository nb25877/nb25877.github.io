# Introduction to Computing

## Overview
A foundation in computing history, programming paradigms, and problem solving for cybersecurity contexts.

## Learning Outcomes
Use this checklist to map evidence (link artifacts below):

- LO1: Explain key computing concepts and history ✅
- LO2: Compare programming languages and paradigms ✅
- LO3: Apply basic programming to solve a problem ✅
- LO4: Reflect on learning and professional practice ✅

## Artifacts
- Report (PDF): [Comparative study of Python vs JavaScript](../assets/artifacts/intro-computing/python-vs-js-report.pdf){ target=_blank }
- Slides (PPTX): [AI in Cybersecurity – Risks & Ethics](../assets/artifacts/intro-computing/ai-cybersecurity.pptx){ target=_blank }
- Code (GitHub): <https://github.com/nb25877/your-repo>
- Video presentation: <https://youtu.be/your-video-id>

## Reflection
Use the prompts below to guide your reflection (keep ~300–500 words):

1. **What did I learn?** Summarize key insights and how they connect to cybersecurity practice.
2. **What went well / what didn’t?** Evidence-based analysis (feedback, grades, peer review).
3. **How did my skills change?** Tie back to the LOs.
4. **What next?** Concrete actions to improve or extend the work.

!!! note "Harvard-style citation example"
    Use in-text citations like: (Bertello *et al.*, 2021).  
    Add full references in a **References** section:

    **References**  
    Bertello, A., et al. (2021) *Title of article*. *Journal*, 12(3), pp. 1–10. DOI: …  
    NIST (2020) *Zero Trust Architecture (SP 800-207)*. Available at: https://doi.org/…
