            "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\">As organisations move away from on-premises IT, it is important to understand cloud service models. Choosing between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS is not just a technical decision. It is a strategic one. This choice affects how much control an organisation has, who is responsible for security, and how quickly services can be delivered. The main difference between these models is the shared responsibility model. It explains which security tasks are handled by the cloud provider and which remain the responsibility of the customer.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Core Differences Between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">IaaS provides basic computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. The cloud provider secures the physical data centres and the underlying infrastructure, while the customer builds and manages everything above this layer. This includes the operating system, middleware, applications, and data. IaaS offers the highest level of control and flexibility, but it also comes with the greatest operational effort and security responsibility for the customer</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Examples include <span class=\"s1\">Amazon Web Services</span> EC2, <span class=\"s1\">Microsoft Azure</span> Virtual Machines, and <span class=\"s1\">Google Cloud</span> Compute Engine (AWS, 2023; Microsoft, 2024).</p>\n<h3><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">PaaS removes the need to manage servers and operating systems. It provides a managed environment where applications can be built and deployed quickly. The customer focuses on application code and data, while the cloud provider manages the platform, runtime, and operating system, including patching and maintenance. This model improves developer productivity and reduces setup time. Security responsibilities are shared, with the customer responsible for securing the application and its data.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Common examples include Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and Heroku (Google, 2024; AWS, 2023).</p>\n<h3><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">SaaS delivers ready to use applications over the internet that users access through a web browser or client application. The cloud provider manages the entire technology stack, including infrastructure, platforms, and application updates. The customer focuses on managing users, access controls, and how data is used within the service. SaaS provides the fastest time to value and requires the least operational effort. Customisation is limited, but reliability and scalability are typically high.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Examples include Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and Slack (Microsoft, 2024).</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Organisational Impact and Strategic Choice</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Each service model shifts responsibility and risk.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 14.55%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Factor</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th style=\"width: 30.2431%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>IaaS</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th style=\"width: 27.2468%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>PaaS</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th style=\"width: 27.9601%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>SaaS</strong></p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 14.55%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Control</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.2431%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Highest level of control</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27.2468%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Limited to application</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27.9601%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Minimal control</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 14.55%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Cost</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.2431%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Lower capital cost, higher skills cost</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27.2468%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Balanced cost model</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27.9601%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Predictable subscription cost</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 14.55%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Speed</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.2431%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Slowest to deploy</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27.2468%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Faster development</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27.9601%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Immediate availability</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 14.55%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Security</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.2431%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Customer secures OS and above</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27.2468%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Shared at application level</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27.9601%;\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Vendor secures most layers</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"p1\">In IaaS, security misconfigurations are a common risk.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In PaaS, insecure code becomes the primary threat.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In SaaS, identity and access management are the main concerns (NIST, 2023)</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Why Organisations Choose Different Models</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Organisations choose PaaS when software development is central to their business because it enables faster application delivery without the overhead of managing infrastructure. SaaS is commonly used for standard business functions such as email, HR, and collaboration tools, as it removes routine operational work and reduces maintenance effort. IaaS remains important for legacy systems and regulated workloads, where greater control is required to meet specific compliance, security, or architectural needs.</p>\n<h2><strong>References</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Amazon Web Services (2023) <i>Shared Responsibility Model</i>.

Both support scaling and on-demand access to resources (Borra, 2024). </p>\n<p>AWS is known for its broad service catalogue and flexibility. It has many products for virtual machines, databases, analytics, and application services. This means users can select from a range of architectural design options. AWS supports complex enterprise use cases well because it has more regions and service maturity (Borra, 2024). </p>\n<p>GCP offers a robust platform for data analytics and cloud native development. It integrates well with Kubernetes and container workloads. Google’s services like BigQuery and Kubernetes Engine are easy to use and scale, making GCP suitable for modern applications and data-heavy workloads (Borra, 2024). </p>\n<p>Pricing models differ between them. AWS uses pay-as-you-go billing with many discount plans such as Reserved Instances and Savings Plans (CloudZero, 2025). GCP uses automatic sustained use and committed use discounts that can make costs more predictable for long-running workloads (CloudZero, 2025). </p>\n<p>In summary, AWS offers greater flexibility, a wide range of services, and robust enterprise support. GCP provides simpler pricing and strengthens analytics, machine learning, and container-based use cases.

What are the main challenges in modelling and evaluating the outcomes of Social Engineering Threats (SETs), and how does this study address them?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The primary challenge in modelling SETs is the inherent unpredictability of human behavior, which makes rigorous mathematical evaluation difficult. Unlike technical exploits, SETs rely on psychological manipulation, which is historically hard to quantify. The study addresses this by structuring SETs not as random events, but as systematic processes involving specific modalities (e.g., email, phone) and persuasion principles (e.g., authority, scarcity). By categorizing these variables, the authors are able to apply Markov Chain models to calculate the probability of an attack moving from one stage to the next.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2. How do persuasion principles and modalities contribute to the success of SETs?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Persuasion principles (derived from Cialdini’s framework, such as Reciprocity, Commitment, and Social Proof) act as the \"exploit code\" of a social engineering attack. The study highlights that the success of a SET depends heavily on the pairing of a Modality (the medium, e.g., social media) with the correct Persuasion Principle. Systematically analyzing these pairs is critical because certain combinations yield higher success rates; for example, \"Authority\" might be more effective via email, while \"Liking\" works better on social media. Understanding these combinations allows defenders to predict which specific scenarios pose the highest risk.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. What role do the Attack Tree Model and Markov Chain Model play in estimating probabilities?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The study utilizes a hybrid approach to estimate risk:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Attack Tree Model:</strong> This is used to calculate the <strong>Attack Occurrence Probability (AOP)</strong>.

How can the findings support the development of effective policy frameworks?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By quantifying the ASP of specific attacks, organizations can move beyond generic \"Security Awareness Training\" to targeted interventions. For instance, if the model shows that the \"Authority\" principle delivered via \"Email\" has the highest success probability, policies can be adjusted to enforce strict verification for executive requests (e.g., mandatory voice confirmation for wire transfers). This allows resources to be allocated based on mathematical risk rankings rather than anecdotal evidence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Aijaz, M. and Nazir, M.

What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</strong> This case addresses <strong>Article 32 (Security of Processing)</strong> and <strong>Article 5(1)(f) (Integrity and Confidentiality)</strong>. The case involved a law firm where a staff member fell victim to a social engineering attack (phishing), allowing a malicious actor to install malware and defraud a client. The core GDPR issue was the data controller's failure to implement \"appropriate technical and organisational measures\" to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Specifically, the firm relied on a cloud email service without enforcing basic industry-standard security settings, such as strong passwords or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2. How was it resolved?</strong> Upon discovering the breach, the firm immediately commissioned a full forensic investigation to determine the root cause and extent of the compromise. Based on the findings, they implemented enhanced technical security measures (specifically enabling MFA) and conducted mandatory cyber security and data protection training for all staff. The DPC concluded the case by requesting updates on these implementations to ensure the risk of reoccurrence was mitigated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3.

What are the key elements and interdependencies in a cyber-physical system that must be captured in a comprehensive threat model?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A comprehensive threat model for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) must move beyond simple asset lists to capture the dynamic relationships between physical and digital components. Jbair et al. (2022) propose a data model that links ten critical parameters: Threat Actors (insider/outsider), Assets (classified by the Purdue Model), Vulnerabilities, Threats (using STRIDE), and Cyber-Attacks (using ICS ATT&amp;CK tactics).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Critically, these elements are interdependent: a <strong>Threat Actor</strong> exploits a <strong>Vulnerability</strong> via specific <strong>Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)</strong> to manipulate an <strong>Asset</strong>. The accuracy of the risk analysis depends on capturing these links because the <strong>Attack Impact</strong> varies depending on the asset's physical function (e.g., a PLC at Level 1 has a higher safety impact than a workstation at Level 4). Failing to map these interdependencies results in a \"siloed\" view that misses cascading physical risks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2. How can threat modelling help identify attack entry points and system vulnerabilities in cyber-physical energy systems?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Threat modelling identifies entry points by mapping the \"attack surface\" exposed by the convergence of IT and OT (Operational Technology). By utilizing frameworks like ICS ATT&amp;CK, analysts can model specific attack trees—such as a \"Man-in-the-Middle\" attack on a PLC or a \"Denial of Service\" on an HMI. This structured approach moves beyond ad-hoc vulnerability scanning to identify complex attack paths where an adversary might pivot from a corporate network (Level 4) to control systems (Level 1).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, a major challenge is that traditional threat modelling tools are often \"static\" and do not integrate with the engineering tools used to build CPS. Jbair et al. (2022) highlight that existing methodologies often lack the ability to determine risk severity or provide a roadmap for mitigation, making it difficult to justify security investments to engineering stakeholders.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. How can scenario-specific metrics and risk assessment methodologies be used to prioritise vulnerabilities?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To effectively prioritize vulnerabilities, organizations must move from qualitative \"guesswork\" to quantitative metrics. The paper proposes a formulaic approach where Risk (R) is the product of the Attack Vector (AV) and Attack Likelihood (AL) (R = AV \\times AL).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Attack Vector (AV):</strong> Calculated using the geometric mean of threat actor skills, threat exposure, and impact severity.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Attack Likelihood (AL):</strong> Derived from historical data of similar attacks in the sector (e.g., assessing if a specific malware strain is trending in the energy sector).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By applying these metrics to a <strong>Risk Heat Map</strong>, vulnerabilities can be classified from \"Very Low\" to \"Very High.\" This allows security teams to automate the generation of <strong>Mitigation Controls</strong> (such as firmware monitoring or password enforcement) specifically for the highest-risk assets, ensuring that limited resources are targeted where they prevent the most significant physical and digital damage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Jbair, M., Ahmad, B., Maple, C. and Harrison, R.

            "content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Based on Kalogiannidis et al. (2024)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>1. How does NLP improve the efficiency and accuracy of risk assessment processes?</strong> Natural Language Processing (NLP) fundamentally shifts risk assessment from a manual, labor-intensive process to an automated one capable of handling vast datasets. Kalogiannidis et al. (2024) highlight that over 80% of enterprise data is unstructured (e.g., text reports, social media), which traditional quantitative methods often struggle to process. By automating the analysis of this unstructured data, NLP significantly speeds up risk identification, finding supported by 70.2% of technology specialists. Furthermore, NLP reduces the human bias and error inherent in manual qualitative assessments, with 79.2% of respondents agreeing it improves identification accuracy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>2. In what ways can AI-powered data analytics enhance risk prediction and support business continuity?</strong> AI-powered analytics enables a transition from reactive to proactive risk management. Unlike traditional methods that rely on historical data and static risk factors, AI analytics can detect subtle patterns and anomalies in real-time streams. The study found that 71.5% of respondents agreed AI enhances the accuracy of predicting <em>potential</em> risks, rather than just reporting on past ones. Crucially, for business continuity, these tools allow for the rapid identification of \"emerging risks\" that have not yet materialised, with 93.5% of professionals noting that it supports a proactive approach.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>3. Why is it important for businesses to integrate multiple AI technologies, beyond just NLP?</strong> While NLP is effective for efficiency, the study’s regression analysis indicates its direct impact on <strong>business continuity</strong> is only moderate compared to other technologies. In contrast, the integration of AI into <strong>Incident Response Planning</strong> demonstrated the highest statistical impact on minimising business disruption (coefficient of 0.361). Therefore, a \"comprehensive strategy\" is required: NLP for data processing, predictive analytics for identifying emerging threats, and AI-driven incident response to enhance resilience during crises. Relying solely on one tool leaves gaps in the Risk Management Process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Kalogiannidis, S., Kalfas, D., Papaevangelou, O., Giannarakis, G. and Chatzitheodoridis, F.
