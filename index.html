I specialise in building <span class="s1"><strong>security-first architectures</strong></span> using Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365 E5, Identity and Access Management (IAM), Zero Trust principles, and modern endpoint security, ensuring organisations remain resilient, compliant, and operationally efficient.</p><p class="p1">Currently, I serve as <span class="s1"><strong>Practice Manager – Datacenter &amp; Cloud at Truly Secure Technologies FZCO</strong></span>, where I built and scaled Managed Security Services from the ground up. What began as a greenfield initiative now supports <span class="s1"><strong>40+ active customers</strong></span>, including regulated financial entities. I have led cloud migrations, SOC strategy, identity governance programs, and compliance initiatives aligned with <span class="s1"><strong>NIST, CIS Benchmarks, UAE NISA, PCI DSS, and DFSI requirements</strong></span>, consistently improving client security posture and audit readiness.</p><p class="p1">My work goes beyond tooling. I focus on <span class="s1"><strong>practical security, </strong></span>designing architectures that real teams can operate, scaling processes that engineers can sustain, and aligning security decisions with executive risk appetite. This includes standing up Zero Trust models, Privileged Identity Management (PIM), conditional access strategies, vulnerability management programs, and automated security monitoring using Microsoft’s security ecosystem.</p><p class="p1">Before relocating to the UAE, I spent a decade as a <span class="s1"><strong>Senior Solution Architect and Pre-Sales Leader</strong></span>, delivering large-scale cloud and security solutions across <span class="s1"><strong>India, North America, and the Middle East</strong></span>. This role sharpened my ability to translate complex technical risk into <span class="s1"><strong>clear business value</strong></span>, working closely with CIOs, CISOs, and executive stakeholders.</p><p class="p1">Earlier in my career, I worked in <span class="s1"><strong>Microsoft enterprise support and critical incident response</strong></span>, handling high-severity Active Directory, Windows Server, and security incidents—experience that continues to ground my architectural decisions in real-world operational realities.</p><p class="p1">Today, my professional focus includes:</p><ul><li><p class="p1">Cloud and identity-led security architecture</p></li><li><p class="p1">Zero Trust and modern workplace security</p></li><li><p class="p1">Managed Security Services and SOC maturity</p></li><li><p class="p1">Risk, compliance, and security governance</p></li><li><p class="p1">Technical leadership and team building</p></li></ul><p class="p1">Alongside industry work, I am currently pursuing an <span class="s1"><strong>MSc in Cyber Security</strong></span>, deepening my engagement with <span class="s1"><strong>risk modelling, ethics, governance, and evidence-based security decision-making</strong></span>. This academic perspective strengthens my ability to evaluate technology not just for effectiveness, but for <span class="s1"><strong>human, ethical, and organisational impact</strong></span>.</p><p class="p1">I believe strong security is not about fear or control, it is about <span class="s1"><strong>clarity, design, and trust</strong></span>. My goal is to help organisations build secure systems that enable growth rather than restrict it.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Nikunj Bhalotia</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://nb25877.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://nb25877.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=d0fc1030089a37f93a2d51bf6d07565c"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
