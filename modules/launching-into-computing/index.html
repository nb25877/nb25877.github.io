  <header class="major"><h2>Module overview</h2></header>
  <p>
    This module introduced the fundamental disciplines that underpin modern enterprise computing:
    <strong>Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Data Science,</strong> and
    <strong>Enterprise IT Management</strong>. It connected technical principles to ethical, legal, and social
    considerations—particularly the role of computing in promoting <strong>equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)</strong>.
    We examined how software design, security controls, AI adoption, data governance, and strategic IT management interact,
    and applied critical, evidence-based thinking to real-world enterprise challenges.

  <header class="major"><h2>Assessed discussion activity</h2></header>

  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> <em>The Evolution of Computing and Its Impact on Business and Society</em> (4-week forum)</p>
  <p><strong>My initial post:</strong> <em>Bridging the Awareness Gap: Cybersecurity Challenges in the Age of Digital Banking</em> (5 May 2025)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Argued that rapid <strong>digital banking</strong> adoption outpaced user awareness, increasing exposure to phishing, credential theft, fake apps, and QR scams.</li>
    <li>Proposed <strong>culturally relevant, accessible awareness programmes</strong> and digital literacy initiatives; cited Google <em>DigiKavach</em> as a scalable model.</li>
    <li>Supported by academic/industry sources on trust, adoption, and limitations of generic awareness campaigns.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Peer responses (highlights):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Raised <strong>AI-driven threats</strong> (e.g., deepfakes) and parallels in other sectors (e.g., healthcare).</li>
    <li>Reinforced need for <strong>community-centric</strong>, culturally aware interventions and cross-stakeholder collaboration.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>My summary (week 4):</strong> Synthesised class feedback, broadened beyond banking, and argued for gamified, <strong>role-specific</strong> training that respects context and addresses inequalities. Conclusion: <strong>Trust + collaboration + relevance</strong> are key to secure digital adoption.</p>

  <p><strong>Discussion feedback:</strong> “Excellent contributions across all areas… evidence-based, well-referenced; timely and constructive; reflective summary that linked back to class discussions.”</p>

  <h3>Part A — Individual Programming Exercise</h3>
  <p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>Evaluating the Development Models of Two Programming Languages</em></p>
  <p><strong>Task:</strong> Build two utilities (Python and JavaScript/Node.js) performing the same function and compare development model, readability, performance, scalability/maintainability, and security.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use-case:</strong> Scheduled ingestion of <strong>Microsoft Graph (Entra ID)</strong> users, sign-in logs, and audit logs into <strong>MongoDB</strong> for retention, analytics, and monitoring.</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> App registration + OAuth; batched Graph queries with pagination; idempotent upsert; counters &amp; checkpoints; Dockerised.</li>
    <li><strong>Dev models:</strong> Python (<code>asyncio</code>, readable, straightforward deps) vs Node.js (event-driven, async-first, rich npm ecosystem).</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Node.js had steadier/lower CPU (peaks ~16%, avg &lt;6%) and finished ~1 minute faster; memory similar; I/O/network comparable.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> No secrets in code; environment variables at runtime; container best practices.</li>
  </ul>

  <header class="major"><h2>Reflection</h2></header>
  <p>
    Although much of the content aligned with my 20+ years of professional computing experience, the module reshaped how I think—especially around
    <strong>equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)</strong>. My learning to date was largely on-the-job and implementation-focused; this academic
    approach encouraged me to step back, apply <strong>critical thinking</strong>, and ground decisions in structured research rather than purely
    operational intuition. It broadened my horizon, strengthened my ability to evaluate solutions against technical, ethical, and societal dimensions,
    and refined how I justify choices for enterprise stakeholders.
