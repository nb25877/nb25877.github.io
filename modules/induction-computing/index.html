  <blockquote>
    <p><em>e-Portfolio: An Employer’s Perspective</em></p>
    <p>
      My name is Nikunj Bhalotia. I work as a Practice Manager for a managed services provider catering to small and medium businesses.
      Shortlisting candidates based solely on CVs is often challenging, as CVs are generic and keyword-driven.
      An e-portfolio, however, allows employers to evaluate real work, thought processes, and practical skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan to integrate real-world cybersecurity project examples into my e-portfolio, making it distinct from undergraduate work.
      The main challenge will be keeping it regularly updated and curating relevant content.
